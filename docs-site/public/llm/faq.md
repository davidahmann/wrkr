# Wrkr FAQ (LLM Context)

## What is Wrkr's primary job?
Wrkr makes long-running agent work operable with durable dispatch, structured supervision, and verifiable outputs.

## Is Wrkr a hosted dashboard product?
No. OSS v1 is CLI-first and offline-first for core flows.

## What should teams review instead of raw token streams?
Typed checkpoint summaries and deterministic acceptance/jobpack artifacts.

## How should teams start?
Run `wrkr demo`, verify the jobpack, then dispatch one real jobspec with acceptance checks.

## What is the OSS versus enterprise boundary?
OSS provides primitives, contracts, and local workflows. Enterprise layering can add fleet controls and policy integrations on top.
