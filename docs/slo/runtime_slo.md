# Runtime SLO

## Service Objectives (OSS Baseline)

- Recovery correctness after restart: deterministic and lossless.
- Jobpack verify correctness: deterministic and tamper-detecting.
- Checkpoint protocol validity: schema-stable across v1.

## Operational Targets

- Fast lane CI remains reproducible and green on release branch.
- Deterministic acceptance checks run locally and in CI.
