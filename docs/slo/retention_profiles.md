# Retention Profiles

## Local Dev

- Keep recent job state and jobpacks for active debugging.
- Prune stale outputs periodically.

## CI

- Retain jobpack and reports for build auditing windows.
- Keep acceptance and summary artifacts with CI retention policy.

## Security

- Prefer reference-only artifact capture unless explicitly required.
